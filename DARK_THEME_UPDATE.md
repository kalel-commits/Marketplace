# Dark Theme Applied

All pages have been updated to use a black/dark theme with:
- Black backgrounds (`bg-black`)
- Dark gray cards (`bg-gray-800`, `bg-gray-900`)
- White/light gray text for readability
- Primary color accents for buttons and links
- Dark borders and inputs

The theme is now consistent across:
- Login/Signup pages
- All dashboards
- Task pages
- Profile pages
- Navigation
